I have created an Internal DSL for defining mathmatical functions to be run on dataseries.
An example of the DSL and running it can be found in Program.cs

## ----MODEL----
An overview of the Semantic model developed can be seen in ClassDiagram.png.

The semantics may be similar to an ExpressionTree, however this concept was discovered after the fact, and as such the solution may be improved by looking that up.

## ----DSL / BUILDER----:
The DSL is achieved through heavy use of operator overloading, see FunctionExpression.cs and DataSeriesExpression.cs. A bit unsure of the dual-purpose of the classes serving both as model elements an builders.

A cool addition is the implemenation of Dynamic Reception through the dynamic feature of C#, see DataSeriesFunctions.cs.

## ----Running----:
The .dll found in the build folder is targetted at .net-core 2.1, with .net core installed it should simply be a matter of running:
dotnet .\MDSDP-Internal-DSL.dll

For building, either use Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tutorials/with-visual-studio-code)
